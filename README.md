# An pytorch implement of two stream convolution network
## Dataset:
+ [ucf-101](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php)
+ [kinetic](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/open-source-data)
## 
+ Model Architecture is defined in model.py, and you can design a customized model here.
+ Dataset loader is defined in dataset.py. we only done the pre-processing of ucf-101 and kinetics.
+ You can use main.py to train or test your model.
